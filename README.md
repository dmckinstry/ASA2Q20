# App Specialist Airlift - Hands-on exercises

The following links are meant to help Airlift attendees get up-to-speed on GitHub as quickly as possible.  This repo is expected to be transitory and will be deleted, but before it is more official assets will be made available.

## 1 - I have a GitHub ID and it is linked to the Microsoft org

Start here if you don't already have a GitHub ID that is liked to the Microsoft org, including 2FA:
1. Sign up for a GitHub ID: https://github.com/join
1. Review Microsoft's policy on Open Source (as if I expect you to really do this):  https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/
1. Link your account and join the appropriate MS orgs: https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/github/accounts/linking.html

## 2 - I know how to use GitHub and GitHub Learning Labs

Even if you've already used GitHub, Learning Lab is a great resource.  It can simulate multi-user interactions similar to real-world GitHub usage. It will guide you though common scenarios collaborating with a bot to drive the lessons. It is also great to be familiar with them so that you can share with customers.

https://lab.github.com - you can figure the rest out pretty easily.

## 3 - I know how to leverage GitHub Security features

Security will be a big reason for customers to consider GitHub in the enterprise.

1. Fork microsoft/ContosoAir which is a demo repo with a few vulnerabilities
   1. Enable **Security Alerts** in your repo settings
   1. Enable **Automated security fixes**
   1. Check back later to see recommended fixes and PRs. Review the PRs and security updates that Dependabot recommends.  You can delete the repo when you're done with this step or save it to share with customers!

## 4 - I have can use GitHub Actions to deploy to Azure
