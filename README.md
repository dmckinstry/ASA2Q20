## 1 - I have a GitHub ID and it is linked to the Microsoft org

Start here if you don't already have a GitHub ID that is liked to the Microsoft org, including 2FA:
1. Sign up for a GitHub ID: https://github.com/join
2. Review Microsoft's policy on Open Source (as if I expect you to really do this):  https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/
3. Link your accound and join the appropriate MS orgs: https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/github/accounts/linking.html

## 2 - I know how to use GitHub and GitHub Learning Labs

Even if you've already used GitHub, Learning Lab is a great way to learn more and also get some realistic experience. In many cases in the field, we are forced to simulate multi-user interactions.  Learning Lab will take you though common lab scenarios by interactively using GitHub, collaborating with a bot. It is also great to be familiar with them so that you can share with customers.
